# Verified Betaflight Partners

## Introduction

Betaflight is an open source firmware project, and runs on third party electronics hardware. This
means that the Betaflight firmware development team does not have control over the hardware
designs or specifications. However the performance of the firmware is related to the hardware
on which it runs. Thus for the sake of the FPV community, this program aims to minimize issues
that users have, by offering recommendations and guidance to manufacturers direct from the
development team. Hardware manufacturers can now benefit from active engagement with the
Betaflight development team - giving them access to their skills, experience and advice - to
produce better hardware and more successful designs.

## Betaflight 4.3 - 'Recommended direction'

For version 4.3 a team of Betaflight developers started a 'Hardware Specification' program
discussing a recommended direction for current and future hardware design and development.
The document 'Manufacturer Design Guidelines' now exists in the 'doc' folder of the Betaflight
repository, and represents the first time that recommendations are officially made directly from
the Betaflight developers to manufacturers. We encourage manufacturers to read this document
and offer feedback.

## Betaflight 4.4 - 'A new relationship'

Since releasing the Manufacturer Guidelines we have opened new communication channels
with selected manufacturers within the application/website 'Discord'. The goal was to discuss
issues and engage with the companies, as well as test their hardware in order to verify the
quality and performance. As part of the incentive to encourage engagement, we are offering a
'Betaflight Partnership' official certification to manufacturers. They can use this certification to
indicate to the userbase that they are supported by Betaflight and our development program.
This will be valuable promotion for them to increase purchasing confidence from customers.

## Compliance and Project Support

At Betaflight we have a high quality coding team who donate their time and skills free of charge.
It is important to retain them in order to progress and maintain the project, and that the work
should not demand financial costs in hardware 'as well' as costs in time and effort. Therefore we
ask that manufacturers donate hardware necessary in order to support the project.
This partnership program is designed to create a 'win-win' scenario for developers and
manufacturers. The Betaflight team can help manufacturers make better products and officially
recommend them to the userbase, and manufacturers can suppcomort the developers with the
necessary hardware. The userbase will then benefit from great hardware, and the future of the
project will be secure.
