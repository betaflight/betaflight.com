# How to Create a Flight Controller Configuration File for Betaflight 4.5

Under construction.

This document describes how to create a flight controller configuration file for Betaflight 4.5 and is a work in progress.

## Introduction
Firmware 4.5 no longer uses unified-targets but instead uses a configuration file for each flight controller.
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a configuration file.

## Overview

1. Create a new configuration file in the [config repository](https://github.com/betaflight/config).
2. The configuration file consists of defines and is independant from using CLI commands. All defines are in the format `#define <setting> [value]`.
3. Other directives can be used in the configuration file, e.g. `#ifdef`, `#else` and `#endif`.

## Configuration

### License Information

The license information is used to identify the license of the firmware. The configuration file needs to start with:

### Board Configuration

    #define FC_TARGET_MCU ATF435M
    #define BOARD_NAME AIRBOTF435
    #define MANUFACTURER_ID AIRB

### Hardware Defines

For a list of hardware defines please see [Hardware Defines](manufacturer-design-guidelines## 4.2 Definitions for Targets)

### Pin Resources

The pin resources are used to configure the pins on the flight controller.

### Timer and Dma Resources

The timer and DMA resources are used to configure the timers and DMA on the flight controller.
Configure the timer in CLI:

Example using a STM32F722:

    #timer
    timer A00 AF2
    # pin A00: TIM5 CH1 (AF2)
    timer A01 AF2
    # pin A01: TIM5 CH2 (AF2)
    timer A02 AF2
    # pin A02: TIM5 CH3 (AF2)
    timer A03 AF2
    # pin A03: TIM5 CH4 (AF2)
    timer B00 AF2
    # pin B00: TIM3 CH3 (AF2)
    timer B01 AF2
    # pin B01: TIM3 CH4 (AF2)
    timer C07 AF3
    # pin C07: TIM8 CH2 (AF3)
    timer C08 AF3
    # pin C08: TIM8 CH3 (AF3)
    timer C09 AF3
    # pin C09: TIM8 CH4 (AF3)

Also set the DMA options, so the command `timer map` outputs the right values, else they will be `-1` for `dmaopt` (which is unused).

e.g.

    dma pin A01 0
    # pin A01: DMA1 Stream 4 Channel 6
    dma pin A00 0
    # pin A00: DMA1 Stream 2 Channel 6

The below is an example of the output after running timer map in CLI:

    #timer map

    Timer Mapping:
     TIMER_PIN_MAP(0, PA0, 2, 0)
     TIMER_PIN_MAP(1, PA1, 2, 0)
     TIMER_PIN_MAP(2, PA2, 2, -1)
     TIMER_PIN_MAP(3, PA3, 2, -1)
     TIMER_PIN_MAP(4, PB0, 2, 0)
     TIMER_PIN_MAP(5, PB1, 2, 0)
     TIMER_PIN_MAP(6, PC7, 2, -1)
     TIMER_PIN_MAP(7, PC8, 2, -1)
     TIMER_PIN_MAP(8, PC9, 2, -1)

To enable the `timer map` command you need to add the define `USE_TIMER_MAP_PRINT` so use either:

    make TARGET EXTRA_FLAGS="-DUSE_TIMER_MAP_PRINT"

The `TIMER_PIN_MAP` config statement is broken down as follows:

`TIMER_PIN_MAP(WW, XX, YY, ZZ)`

* WW - zero-indexed counter, increment by 1 for each line in the timer map
* XX - pin number to set the timer on
* YY - selected instance of the timer configuration where multiple options are available. See your MCU's target timer code for the list of options. For example F772 should reference [this timer file](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/src/main/drivers/stm32/timer_stm32f7xx.c).
* ZZ - DMA setting for that timer, same number as used in the `dma pin <pin number> <dma>` command.

### Serial Configuration

The serial configuration is used to configure the serial ports on the flight controller. The following defines are available:

| Value  | Function define      |
| ------:| -------------------- |
| 1      | MSP_UART             |
| 2      | GPS_UART             |
| 64     | SERIALRX_UART        |
| 32     | SBUS_TELEMETRY_UART  |
| 1024   | ESC_SENSOR_UART      |
| 2048   | VTX_SMARTAUDIO_UART  |
| 8192   | VTX_TRAMP_UART       |
| 131072 | VTX_MSP_UART         |
| 131073 | MSP_DISPLAYPORT_UART |

The following example shows how to configure the serial ports for a flight controller with a GPS and SmartAudio VTX.

    #define SERIALRX_UART SERIAL_PORT_USART1
    #define VTX_SMARTAUDIO_UART SERIAL_PORT_USART3
    #define GPS_UART SERIAL_PORT_USART4

Note: serial command is zero index based, so the first serial port is `SERIAL_PORT_USART1` and not `SERIAL_PORT_USART0`.

### Serial Receiver Provider

BNF boards may want to configure the serial receiver provider on the flight controller. Example:

    #define SERIALRX_PROVIDER CRSF

### ADC Configuration

The ADC configuration is used to configure the ADC on the flight controller.

### Bus Configuration

The bus configuration is used to configure the I2C and SPI buses on the flight controller.

### LED Configuration

The LED configuration is used to configure the LED on the flight controller.

### OSD Configuration

The OSD configuration is used to configure the OSD on the flight controller.

### VTX Configuration

The VTX configuration is used to configure the VTX on the flight controller.
