# Missing Board

If you can't find your board here, please see if it is listed in the [Betaflight Github configs list](https://github.com/betaflight/config/tree/master/configs)

F1, F3 and other older boards are in the [board archive](/docs/category/archive-1)

If a current board is not listed here, please ask the manufacturer to make a pull request as described in our [manufacturer design guidelines](/docs/development/manufacturer/manufacturer-design-guidelines)
