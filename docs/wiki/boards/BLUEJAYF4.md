### FrSky Smartport

Frysky smartport (or s-port) is inverted, and half duplex. You can modify your X4R or XSR by following the procedure here [https://blck.mn/2016/06/smartport-the-frsky-x4rs-and-betaflight/](https://blck.mn/2016/06/smartport-the-frsky-x4rs-and-betaflight/) and here (for a cleaner modification thats easily switchable between inverted and non-inverted) [https://blck.mn/2016/12/smartport-frsky-x4rs-and-betaflight-part-2/](https://blck.mn/2016/12/smartport-frsky-x4rs-and-betaflight-part-2/)

For rev3 users, the addition of a diode on UART1, and the use of the builds in BF3.1 or later allow direct connection of s-port without modifying your RX unit.

You will need to run the following in the CLI:

`set sport_halfduplex=OFF`

### Serial Wire Debug

Serial Wire Debug output is located on the bottom of the board, and provides a pin out compatible with STM32Fx discovery boards to be used as a SWD adapter:

# Known Issues:

The rev2 requires a resistor mod to prevent the issue of crashing on power up. The rev3 does not have this issue.

Following the picture below to perform the Rev2 resistor modification:

The rev2 onboard regulator is limited in current capacity, and has been replaced with a pololu piggy back option for greater flexibility.

# Configuring 4th UART (3.2 and later)

- 4th hardware UART (UART4) is supported on motor outputs 1 and 2, but it is hidden until explicitly turned on by resource commands.
- Motor outputs 1 and 2 must be remapped to avoid collision with UART4.

### Example

Below is a sequence of resource commands to configure UART4, shift motor outputs by two (Motor 1 to motor output 3, motor 2 to motor output 4 and so on) and use DEBUG pad for LED strip.

```
# Disable functions on motor outputs 5 and 6 so motors can be shifted by two
resource SERIAL_TX 11 NONE
resource SERIAL_RX 11 NONE
resource MOTOR 5 NONE
resource MOTOR 6 NONE

# Remap LED
resource LED_STRIP 1 B03

# Remap motors
resource MOTOR 3 B00
resource MOTOR 4 B01
resource MOTOR 1 A02
resource MOTOR 2 A03

# Configure UART4
resource SERIAL_TX 4 A00
resource SERIAL_RX 4 A01
```
