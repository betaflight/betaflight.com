#KroozX

## Description

The KroozX combo is a combination of flight controller and 4in1 Blheli_S(BB2) ESC boards with a lot of useful features, like onboard OSD with 2 video channel switch, micro-SD card slot, 2 powerful BECs, LC filter for clear picture transmission and many more. It utilizes powerful SMT32F4 processor and two inertial sensors: MPU6000 (SPI bus) and ICM20608 (I2C bus), which gives an opportunity to build a highly responsible quadcopter with redundand IMU for more safety in flight. Proper wiring and schematics decreases the GYRO and GPS noise level, increasing the flight performance. An optional onboard HM-TRP or HC-12 (2 different board versions) transceiver enables wireless setup and control during flight.
