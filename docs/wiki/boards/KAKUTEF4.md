# KakuteF4-AIO

## Description

The Holybro Kakute F4 All-In-One flight controller makes it easy to build your multirotor. It integrates flight controller (FC), power distribution board (PDB), and on-screen display (OSD) in one. The Kakute F4 AIO’s layout makes it easy to wire up the other components of the multirotor while keeping the build neat and tidy.

## Features

•Supports Betaflight and Cleanflight.

•Betaflight OSD. Change PIDs, adjust common configuration parameters, and change video transmitter channel and power level, all using your transmitter sticks and goggles.

•Soft-mounting built in. The “gyro” chip on this board is mounted on vibration-isolating foam. This means that there is no need to soft-mount the board itself.

•New high-performance / low-noise / high sensitivity IMU. ICM20689 with 6-axis gyro and accelerometer. Can run at up to 32 kHz.

•2 oz copper PCB allows up to 120A maximum continuous current.

•Dedicated bootloader button for easy firmware flashing.

•Low-profile design fits into even very compact frames.

•Input voltage 7v to 42v. Power the board directly from the flight pack, up to 6S (on “BAT” pad only).

•Automatic voltage monitoring. No need to run a separate vBat wire for voltage monitoring; the Kakute F4 AIO monitors voltage directly from the battery power lead.

•Filtered voltage output for clean, noise-free video. On-board regulators output 5v at up to 1.5 amps and 3.3v at up to 200 mA to power peripherals such as receiver, video transmitter, FPV camera, or LED strip.

•Supports BLHeli passthrough for easy ESC upgrade and configuration.

SmartPort:

Kakute F4's bidir inverter is designed with mosfet.We have tested the smartport of each board with XSR receiver and X9D in factory. But there are some special XSR receivers, who's input capacitance are higher than the normal, it may cause the smartport waveform distorted. The waveform don't drop to 0v during low period. See the following picture.

Change a resistor on the KakuteF4 from 4.53K to 2.2K, the waveform looks good. That may be the reason.

If the SmartPort don't work stable, please try this way. If you don't have a SMD resistor, you can use a 5.1K plug-in resistor to bypass SmartPort signal to GND. It has the same effect.

And we have changed this resistor from 4.53K to 2.2K at the secondary produce.
