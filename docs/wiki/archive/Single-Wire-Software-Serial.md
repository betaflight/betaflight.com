# Single Wire Soft Serial

### Disclaimer:

Software Serial is not recommended for RC control links and should not be used to connect serial receivers.

### Software Serial List of compatible pins

Not for public viewing yet.

List of compatible pins.

CLI commands to free up PWM 5 and PWM 6:

`resource MOTOR 5 NONE`

`resource MOTOR 6 NONE`

CLI commands to assign softserial:

`resource serial_tx 11 <pin>`

`resource serial_tx 12 <pin>`

NOTE:

- The OK means it is compatible, and does not warrant it will work when it is configured as a part of a complete system.

@olexs: B07 (PWM7/SDA) works with S.Audio on 3.2, no extra config needed (I2C resources aren't mapped per default).

Note (2017-07-27) by @jflyper: BETAFLIGHTF3 had a timer assignment problem with pre-3.2 firmware. It is fixed with 3.2, and PB01 and A02 should work as software serial --- need to be verified
(29/10/17) by @iwarp B01 confirmed working on 3.2.1
