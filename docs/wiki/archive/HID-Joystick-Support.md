HID joystick support is currently only available on F4 / F7 boards.

To enable it, set `usb_hid_cdc` to `on` in CLI, and reboot the flight controller. It will then be recognised as a HID joystick when plugged in via USB.

For Windows 7, a driver needs to be installed, it can be downloaded from [here](resources/hid_driver_windows_7.zip).
