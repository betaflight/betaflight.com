# Channel Forwarding

_Use SERVO_TILT for applications with servo count requirement less than or equal to 2._

- If servo count requirement is less than or equal to 2, then SERVO_TILT is a better option, because it gives you a freedom of which AUX channel to assign to servos.
- With SERVO_TILT, you can adjust servo parameters.
- An effect of SERVO_TILT can be observed in Motors tab of configurator, giving you more confidence during configuration process.
