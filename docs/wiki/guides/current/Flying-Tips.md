## How To Fly An FPV Multirotor In Acro Mode

Joshua Bardwell's excellent series of 27 lessons that use the free FPV Freerider simulator to teach a complete beginner how to fly an FPV multirotor in Acro mode (no autoleveling). A great resource for those wishing to transition from Level/Horizon modes to Acro mode.

## Making coordinated turns in Acro mode

In autolevel modes (Angle or Horizon), the flight controller attempts to maintain a fixed angle of pitch or roll which is proportional to the stick deflection. In Acro mode this assistance is not present and the pilot needs to compensate manually. This video explains how this is achieved in flight.
