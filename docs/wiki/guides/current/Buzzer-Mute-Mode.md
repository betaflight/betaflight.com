# Buzzer Mute Mode

With Beeper Mute Mode you can silence the buzzer as long it's not needed.

Setup a switch to activate beeper and deactivate beeper mute mode. We can do that in the "Modes" tab of the Configurator.

Eg.:

```
   AUX5 < 1500 -> 'Beeper mute' is active, 'Beeper' is inactive.
   AUX5 > 1500 -> 'Beeper mute' is inactive, 'Beeper' is active.
```
