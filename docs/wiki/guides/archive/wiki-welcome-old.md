## Wiki Tips:

- Searching the Wiki-
  Type in URL bar of the Web Browser:
  "site:github-wiki-see.page/m/betaflight/betaflight/wiki PT1" (wiki search for term 'PT1' with a third-party service as [GitHub does not permit native indexing of Wiki pages](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992))
  or
  "site:github.com/betaflight/betaflight PT1" (broader search for term 'PT1')

- Note that Default settings as well as CLI commands may change from one Version to the next. We try to list these under the Version Release Notes but not always get them all. a method to use to keep track of changes and to check these yourself is:
  After Flashing but before configuring do the CLI Dump then Copy/paste this into a Text file named with V#. Then on next update do this again to a new text file.
  This allows you to check for differences by either manually compared the two text files or by using an Difference option in a text editor. NotePad++ is one such editor with a good difference feature.

- If not in this Wiki please try the [docs](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/tree/master/docs) directory as another source for information. Note: includes some documentation from Cleanflight

- All BASICs and alternate methods to config and flash are in the NAZE32 Manual here: http://www.abusemark.com/downloads/naze32_rev2.pdf

## Introduction

Betaflight is software that is open source and is available free of charge without warranty to all users.

Betaflight is a Cleanflight fork started by BorisB. It used to work as a beta test platform for Cleanflight and kept pushing the envelope in terms of performance, but it eventually evolved into a fully grown up, stable and well maintained firmware by various developers. In fact it looks like it is the number 1 open source multi-rotor firmware according to Google Trends analysis around January 2017.

The name "Beta" comes from the fact it started with a goal to keep trying new things out and have quick and easy test distributions available. The name "Beta" has stuck as the brand name was strong at the moment where it transitioned from beta to stable and there was already a lot of documentation around.

"This project also helps by contributing to other open source projects like iNav." - says Boris B ([lead developer](http://www.youtube.com/user/bozic1982/featured))

## Tools

Betaflight is also always being adjusted to support most current Cleanflight tools like Configurator and EzGui devices and many other MSP tools. There is no special tool needed just for Betaflight.

## Firmware Releases

Releases can be found here: https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/releases or downloaded from configurator.
Also check the Upgrading List to the Right for Release Notes and other Details on the various Versions.

_BETA TESTING (WARNING)_

_If you want to contribute to better development you can download and test the latest nightly beta builds directly from:_ *https://ci.betaflight.tech/job/Betaflight/lastBuild/artifact/obj/*

## Pull Requests

When proposing a change to the code, whether a bug fix or an improvement, create a [pull request](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pulls), or 'PR', using Github. PR's are carefully checked and tested before being merged. You can contribute greatly to the development by testing PR's and providing feedback on the PR.

Pre-built hex files for every pull request are available for testing. The Betaflight download includes hex files for the four main unified targets; Configurator and BlackBox downloads include applications for Windows, Mac and Linux.

- scroll to the bottom of the PR.
- at `All checks have passed` line, click `Show all checks` to the right,
- in the `Release Release` line, click `Details`, to the right,
- under `Release Release succeeded`, click `0 errors / 0 warnings`,
- In the Stages / Build section, at the bottom, click on ’artifact’. For Betaflight PR's, click `1 artefact`, for Configurator PR's click ‘4 artefacts’.
- A new window opens; hover over the download line. A three vertical dot dropdown appears at right, choose `Download artefacts`.

This should download a zip file containing hex files of the PR.

You can find release planning here:

## Configuration Tool

To configure Betaflight you should use the latest stable Betaflight-configurator GUI tool (Windows/OSX/Linux) that can be found in the Betaflight Configurator repository:
https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases

_BETA TESTING_
