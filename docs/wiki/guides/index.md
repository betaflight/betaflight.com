# Information for Betaflight pilots

Our **[Current guides](/docs/category/current-guides)** are documents that apply to recent versions of Betaflight. Some need updating, but most should be relevant and helpful.

4.5 users may want to check out:

- [Betaflight 4.5 release notes](/docs/wiki/release/Betaflight-4.5-Release-Notes.md)
- [Betaflight 4.5 GPS Rescue notes](/docs/wiki/guides/current/GPS-Rescue-v4-5.md)
- [Updated Failsafe notes](/docs/wiki/guides/current/Failsafe.md)
- [Magnetometer information](/docs/wiki/guides/current/Magnetometer.md)

The **[Archive](/docs/category/archive)** contains deprecated documents that are being kept purely for historical reasons. They are either:

- so old as to be irrelevant,
- inaccurate,
- incomplete, or
- refer to software code that is no longer active.
