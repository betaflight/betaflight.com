# Information for Betaflight pilots

Our **[Current guides](/docs/category/current-guides)** are documents that apply to recent versions of Betaflight. Some need updating, but most should be relevant and helpful.

The **[Archive](/docs/category/archive)** contains deprecated documents that are being kept purely for historical reasons. They are either:

- so old as to be irrelevant,
- inaccurate,
- incomplete, or
- refer to software code that is no longer active.

:::caution
All information here is a work in progress.
Please let us know if anything is incorrect, or needs updating.
If something is missing, please be patient. It will come!
