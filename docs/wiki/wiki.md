# Welcome to the Wiki

## Find everything betaflight related

You may or may not know that there was an old GitHub wiki. On one hand, it was a great resource to find
all sorts of info... on the other, it was pretty clunky, outdated and hard to maintain. So we decided to
upgrade it to a new, more modern support section, which you're currently reading!

:::caution Work in progress

This support section is still new and is very much a work in progress. Pages going to be added, updated and improved
pretty every day in the weeks to come. So if you're missing something, please be patient. It will come!
You can also help us out, check out the `#documentation` channel on the
[Discord server](https://discord.betaflight.com/invite) for more info.

## What's new?

The new support section is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which is far better than what the
GitHub Wiki feature offers. It's a lot more modern, easier to maintain and has a lot more features. Plus,
I'd say that it looks a lot better too.

We're planning on writing nearly every page from scratch, so that we can make sure that the information
is up to date and correct. This does mean that we're going to be missing a lot of pages for a little while.

## How to use

Support is split up into different sections. You can find the sidebar on the left side of the page,
which contains links to all the different sections. You can also use the search bar at the top of the
page to search for a specific word or phrase

## How to contribute

If you want to help out, you can do so by creating a pull request on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight.com). You can find a reference
page for writing MDX with the features we use, and if you're still not sure how to do something, you can
ask in the `#documentation` channel on the [Discord server](https://discord.betaflight.com/invite) as we
mentioned above
