# CLI Tab

BetaFlight has a command line interface (CLI) that can be used to:

- review, change and save settings and configure the FC, including those not accessible via the Configurator's GUI
- check the version of the firmware
- check task timing and late runs
- check the hardware status
- and do a lot more, including bad things that can burn out the motor break functionality.

For more information see our [CLI reference document](/docs/development/Cli.md)
