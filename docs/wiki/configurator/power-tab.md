# Power & Battery Tab

Set up all your power and battery related settings. Set the voltage and current sensor sources and
calibration so that the FC can read the values and warn you accordingly. You can also check the current
power measurements

## Battery

### Voltage Meter Source

Select the source for the voltage measurements

- **None** - No voltage measurements will be available
- **ESC Sensor** - Use the ESC telemetry to get the voltage measurements
- **Onboard ADC** - Use the ADC on the flight controller to get the voltage measurements

### Current Meter Source

Select the source for the current measurements

- **None** - No current measurements will be available
- **ESC Sensor** - Use the ESC telemetry to get the current measurements
- **MSP Sensor/OSD Slave** - _NEEDS REVIEW, FOR ONCE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS_
- **Onboard ADC** - Use the ADC on the flight controller to get the current measurements

### Min/Max/Warning Cell Voltage

- **Minimum Cell Voltage** - The voltage that is considered critically low, and will trigger the corresponding warnings
- **Maximum Cell Voltage** - The voltage of a fully charged Cell
- **Warning Cell Voltage** - The voltage that is considered low, and will trigger the corresponding warnings

:::danger

The warning voltage should be set to a value where you can still land safely, usually 3.6-3.5V.

The minimum voltage should be set to a value where damage is imminent, usually 3.3V.
<br></br>
If you fly a battery to less than 3.3V, it will start to be damaged and will not be able to hold a charge anymore, and can even be dangerous

:::

### Capacity

The capacity of the battery in mAh. This is used to calculate the remaining battery capacity in percent.

## Voltage Meter

Settings for the voltage meter to measure the battery voltage correctly

### Scale

The scale of the voltage meter. This is used to calculate the correct voltage from the ADC value. If the battery
voltage is not displayed correctly, you can adjust this value up/down to fix it

### Divider / Multiplier Value

This defines how the value read by the ICs ADC converts into a voltage value that makes sense to the pilot.
In easy terms this sets how the ratio difference between the two voltage divider resistors are used in the voltage calculation formula.

Example:  
Scale: 110 = 10:1 voltage divider (10k:1k ohm resistors)  
Divider: 10 = sets the direct resistor to resistor ratio  
Multiplier: 1 = this is to fine-tune the outcome of the calculation, a value of 1 is "no correction"

## Amperage Meter

Settings for the amperage meter to measure the current draw correctly, using this formula:

$$
Current(Amps) = \frac\{ADC (mV)}\{amperage\_meter\_scale \times 10 + \frac\{amperage\_meter\_offset}\{1000}}
$$

### Scale

The scale of the amperage meter. Used in the calculation to get the correct current draw from the ADC value

### Offset

The offset of the amperage meter, rarely needed

## Power State

- **Connected** - Yes/No, if Yes, also shows cell count
- **Voltage** - Voltage of the battery
- **mAh Used** - Capacity used in mAh
- **Amperage** - Current draw
