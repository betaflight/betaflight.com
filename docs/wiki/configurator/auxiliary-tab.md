# Modes Tab

Modes are used to enable or disable features and trigger FC actions using AUX channels switches. Modes are enabled
when Ranges or Links are active.

| Setting | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ranges  | Activate when the receiver channel matches the specified input values. A receiver channel that gives a reading between a range min/max will activate the mode. |
| Links   | Activate when another linked Mode is active.                                                                                                                   |

Multiple Ranges, Links can be matched, combined using boolean AND or OR operators to combine activation conditions for a Mode.
