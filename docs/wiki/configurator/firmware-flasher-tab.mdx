# Firmware Flasher Tab

Here you update your firmware and select the features you require for you build.

:::info

The Firmware contains only hardware support. Board configuration defines board specific hardware. With the Build Configuration you can add or remove features you need.

:::

## Preparation

* Upgrade to the latest Betaflight Configurator.

* Before upgrading always save a <b>diff</b> of the current configuration. Using <b>status</b> command you get some info about hardware being used.
* You can also save a <b>diff</b> using Presets tab using the <b>save backup</b> button.
* Except <b>master</b> and <b>profile</b> most settings should be able to migrate from a previous version.

:::caution

Please follow these steps in order to be able to restore in the event something is not supported.<br/><br/>
Configurator only supports Betaflight version 4.0 and newer. Older versions only have access to the firmware flasher tab or CLI.

:::


## Flashing

| Type | Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| Release | Stable | None |
| Candidate | Preview |
| Development | Test |

* After selecting a build type select the board using the list or use the <b>Auto-detect</b> button.
* Always use <b>Full Chip Erase</b> unless instructed otherwise.

:::note

Using <b>Show Release Candidates</b> with <b>Expert Mode</b> enabled gives access to development builds.

:::


### Board Defines

We have defines for <b>ACC</b>, <b>BARO</b>, <b>FLASH</b>, <b>GYRO</b>, <b>MAX7456</b>, <b>FLASH</b> or <b>SDCARD</b>  in the board configuration.

:::info

If your board pheriperals are not recognized please help us add the required configuration details.
<br/>
Reach out on our Discord or create an issue in the Betaflight unified targets repo.
<br/>
To get the required information follow this procedure:
<br/><br/>
1. Flash your board with the <b>Core Only</b> switch enabled<br/>
2. Go to the CLI tab and click the <b>Submit Support Data</b> button.<br/>
3. With this generated support <b>ID</b> we have all required information to update board configuration files.

### Radio Protocols

Select the receiver wire protocol used. The most common are:

| Protocol | Receiver |
| :--- | :--- |
| CRSF | TBS Crossfire or ExpressLRS |
| GHST | Immersion RC Ghost |
| SBUS | FrSky or Futaba |

:::note

EXPRESSLRS (SPI) receivers uses CRSF protocol.<br/>
FrSky (SPI) receivers uses SBUS or FPORT protocol depending on the receiver firmware used.

:::


### Telemetry Protocols

Select the telemetry protocol used. For CRSF, ELRS or GHST protocols this is included by default to ease configuraton.

:::note

ExpressLRS uses CRSF protocol. SPI configuration is done in the board configuration.

| EMFAT_AUTORUN | Adds FAT emulation for onboard flash or MSC |
| EMFAT_ICON | Adds (Windows) icon for FAT Emulation |
| ESCSERIAL_SIMONK | Adds support for SimonK ESC Firmware |
| FRSKYOSD | Adds FrSky OSD support |
| GPS_PLUS_CODES | Use Open Location Code |
| SERIAL_4WAY_SK_BOOTLOADER | Allow flashing APD / BlHeli ESC using serial 4way |
| SERVOS | Add Servo support |
| VARIO | Add Vario support |


:::info

Expert settings needs to enabled to use other options in <b>Custom Defines</b> field.

To access <b>Expert Settings</b> you need to enable <b>show releases candidates</b>.

## Local Flashing

To flash local development firmware with optional custom configuration use the <b>Load Firmware local</b> button to load board configuration or click `Auto-detect` or when in `DFU` mode select a board manually.

:::note

If using a local configuration file use the same button again to load a local hex file.

## Troubeshooting

:::tip

* Use a good quality data cable not a power cable.
* USB hubs or OTG cables are sometimes needed with recent computers and in other cases they can cause issues.
* Try disconnecting all cables from your PC first, try rebooting, other ports, upgrade system drivers. Remove other USB connections.
* Try DFU mode (use boot button on FC while plugging in, use <b>Activate Boot Loader / DFU</b> button in setup tab or use <b>bl</b> command in CLI.
* Sometimes peripherals on the flight controller such as receivers or GPS devices can hijack port communication requiring de-soldering.
* Linux needs configuration to allow flashing.
* MacOS or Windows do not need any drivers.
* If it still doesn't work try IRC Driver Fix or Zadig on Windows platform.
