# Firmware Flasher tab

Here you update your firmware and select the features you require for you build.

:::info

The Firmware only contains only hardware support. Board configuration defines board specific hardware.
With the Build Configuration you can add or remove features you need.

:::

## Preparation

* Upgrade to the latest Betaflight Configurator.

* Before upgrading always save a `diff` of the current configuration. Using `status` command you get some info about hardware being used.
* You can also save a `diff` using Presets tab using the `save backup` button.
* Except `master` and `profile` most settings should be able to migrate from a previous version.

:::note

Configurator only supports Betaflight version 4.0 and beyond. Older versions only have access to the firmware flasher tab or CLI.

:::


## Flashing

| Type | Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| Release | Stable | None |
| Candidate | Preview |
| Development | Test |

* After selecting a build type select the board using the list or use the `Auto-detect` button.
* Always use `Full Chip Erase` unless instructed otherwise.

:::note

Using `Show Release Candidates` with `Expert Mode` enabled gives access to development builds.

:::


### Board defines

We have defines for `ACC`, `BARO`, `FLASH`, `GYRO`, `MAX7456`, `FLASH` or `SDCARD`  in the board configuration.

:::note

If we are missing any information please reach out on Discord to help us add any missing defines to the configuration.

:::


### Radio protocols

Select the receiver wire protocol used. The most common are:

| Protocol | Receiver |
| :--- | :--- |
| CRSF | TBS Crossfire or ExpressLRS |
| GHST | Immersion RC Ghost |
| SBUS | FrSky or Futaba |

:::info

EXPRESSLRS (SPI) receivers use CRSF protocol. FrSky (SPI) receivers uses SBUS or FPORT protocol depending on the receiver firmware used.

:::


### Telemetry protocols

Select the telemetry protocol used. For CRSF, ELRS or GHST protocols this is included by default to ease configuraton.

:::info

ExpressLRS uses CRSF protocol. SPI configuration is done in the board configuration.

:::


### Other options

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| AKK (SA Fix) | Smartaudio patch for AKK hardware |
| DASHBOARD | Post-flight overview screen |
| FLASH | Enable blackbox Flash Tools |
| GPS | Enable GPS |
| LED Strip | Enable 32 LEDs |
| LED Strip 64 | Enable 64 LEDs |
| MAG | Enable magnetometer |
| OSD_SD | Enable SD OSD (onboard MAX7456 required) |
| OSD_HD | Enable HD OSD |
| PIN IO | Enable PINIO |
| VTX | Enable VTX |


### Motor protocol

Select ESC protocol being used. DShot is default.

:::tip

When needed additional protocols like `PWM` or `SERVOS` please add them using Custom Defines.

:::


### Custom defines

You can add a custom define to bake a feature into the build which would not fit before:

| Define | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| ACRO_TRAINER | Adds Acro Trainer support |
| BATTERY_CONTINUE | See [#11084](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/pull/11084) |
| CAMERA_CONTROL | Adds Camera Control |
| EMFAT_AUTORUN | Adds FAT emulation for onboard flash or MSC |
| EMFAT_ICON | Adds (Windows) icon for FAT Emulation |
| ESCSERIAL_SIMONK | Adds support for SimonK ESC Firmware |
| FRSKYOSD | Adds FrSky OSD support |
| GPS_PLUS_CODES | Use Open Location Code |
| LAUNCH_CONTROL | Adds Launch Control |
| SERIAL_4WAY_SK_BOOTLOADER | Allow flashing APD / BlHeli ESC using serial 4way |
| SERVOS | Add Servo support |
| VARIO | Add Vario support |


## Local flashing

To flash local development firmware with optional custom configuration use the `Load Firmware local` button to load board configuration or click `Auto-detect` or when in `DFU` mode select a board manually.

:::note

If using a local configuration file use the same button again to load a local hex file.

:::


:::tip

* Use a good quality data cable not a power cable.
* USB hubs are sometimes needed in other cases they can cause issues.
* Try disconnecting all cables from your PC first, try rebooting, other ports, upgrade system drivers. Remove other USB connections.
* Try DFU mode (use boot button on FC while plugging in, use `Activate Boot Loader / DFU` button in setup tab or use `bl` command in CLI.
* Sometimes peripherals on the flight controller such as receivers or GPS devices can hijack port communication requiring de-soldering.
* Linux needs configuration to allow flashing.
* MacOS or Windows do not need any drivers.
* If it still doesn't work try IRC Driver Fix or Zadig on Windows platform.
