# Failsafe Tab

Failsafe is the action your craft takes when it loses connection to the transmitter.
This tab allows you to configure what your craft does in an event of a failsafe.

:::danger
It is very important to set up your failsafe correctly to prevent your craft from flying away or crashing when you lose connection.
:::

## Failsafe Stages

There are two stages of failsafe:

- **Stage 1** - entered when a flight channel has an invalid pulse length, the receiver reports failsafe mode or
  there is no signal from the receiver at all, the channel fallback settings are applied to all channels and
  a short amount of time is provided to allow for recovery.

- **Stage 2** - entered when the error condition takes longer than the configured guard time while the craft is armed,
  all channels will remain at the applied channel fallback setting unless overruled by the chosen procedure.

:::note
Prior to entering **stage 1**, channel fallback settings are also applied to individual AUX channels that have invalid pulses.
:::

## Valid Pulse Range Settings

**Minimum length** - The minimum length of the valid pulse range. If a channel goes below this value, the FC will be put into failsafe mode.

**Maximum length** - The maximum length of the valid pulse range. If a channel goes above this value, the FC will be put into failsafe mode.

:::info
For most cases, you should leave these settings at their default values.
:::

## Failsafe Switch

This setting determines which stage of failsafe will be activated when manually engaging the Failsafe mode from your
controller using the Aux Mode.

- **Stage 1** - activates Stage 1 failsafe. This is useful if you want to simulate the exact signal loss failsafe behavior.
- **Stage 2** - skips Stage 1 and activates the Stage 2 procedure immediately
- **Kill** - disarms instantly (your craft will crash)

## Stage 1 - Channel Fallback Settings

These settings are applied to invalid individual AUX channels or to all channels when entering **stage 1**.

:::note
Values are saved in steps of 25usec, so small changes disappear
:::

You can set the channel fallback settings for each channel individually.

The available options for each channel are:

- **Auto** - Roll, Pitch and Yaw will be set to the center position, Throttle will be set to the minimum value.
  (this is only available for the first 4 channels)
- **Hold** - The channel will hold its last valid value.
- **Set** - You can set a custom value for the channel.

## Stage 2 - Failsafe Procedure

There are three options for the failsafe procedure:

- **Drop** (default) - The craft will disarm and fall out of the sky.
- **Land** - The craft will attempt to land.
- **GPS Rescue** - The craft will attempt to return to the home position.

### Land options

- **Throttle value used while landing** - The throttle value the craft will use while landing.
- **Delay for turning off the motors during Failsafe [seconds]** - Time to stay in landing mode until the motors turn off.

:::warning
Betaflight can't detect when the craft has landed, it will only disarm after the delay has passed.
Use this feature with caution.

If the throttle value is too high, the craft will ascend instead of landing.
:::

### GPS Rescue options

Hereâ€™s the revised table with the sublists formatted in one row:

| **Option**                              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Maximum pitch angle**                 | The maximum pitch angle the craft will use to return to the home position. Rescue throttle usually needs to be increased if the pitch angle is increased. If pitch angle is too low, the craft might not be able to return in high winds.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Throttle hover**                      | The throttle value the craft will use to hover at the return altitude. **It is important to set this value accurately.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Minimum distance to home (meters)**   | The minimum distance that the craft has to be from the home position to activate GPS Rescue. If the rescue starts too close to home, the craft will fly away until this distance is reached, then start the normal rescue behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Minimum satellites**                  | The minimum number of satellites required to activate GPS Rescue.

| **Allow arming without fix**            | Allows arming without a GPS fix. If enabled and armed before GPS fix is acquired, the craft will disarm on loss of signal. If enabled, you cannot take off without a GPS fix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Sanity checks**                       | <li>**On (highly recommended)**: The craft will perform sanity checks before starting the rescue; if the checks fail, the craft will disarm.</li><li>**Off**: The craft will not perform sanity checks before starting the rescue, potentially leading to flying away or crashing.</li><li>**Failsafe only**: Sanity checks will only be performed on an actual loss of signal, not triggered if GPS Rescue is activated using the Aux mode.</li> |

## Testing Failsafe

:::danger
It is very important to make sure your failsafe works as expected

Failure to do so can result in lost or damaged equipment, or even injury to yourself or others.
:::

- When using the **Drop** failsafe, the easiest way to test it is to arm your craft **with your props off**,
  then turn off your transmitter. The motors should stop.
- When using other failsafe procedures, you can test them by settings up the **failsafe** mode on a switch,
  and carefully activating it in an open area. If something goes wrong, you can revert the position of the switch
  to stop the failsafe procedure.
- For GPS Rescue, there is a **GPS Rescue** mode that can be activated independently of the failsafe mode.

:::tip
If a switch-induced Landing or Rescue test has a problem, or seems to float around, DO NOT DISARM IN PANIC!
Undo the Rescue switch promptly and you'll get full control back immediately. Do not wait more than 15s or it may disarm and crash.
