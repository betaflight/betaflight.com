# Betaflight Sponsors

Betaflight is an open source project with over half a million users. It is the biggest UAV firmware in the sector and as such requires constant development to keep pushing forwards with new features, and significant maintenance and management to remain compatible with third party hardware.
The development team are passionate advocates of the sector, and have developed working relationships with the best companies in the business.

We have chosen a selection of these companies that we use to support the development team through sponsorship. We are proud to work together with the following brands:
