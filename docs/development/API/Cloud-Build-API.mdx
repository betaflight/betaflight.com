# Betaflight 4.4 Cloud Build API

## API

Avoiding EOL on 512K targets we have introduced a cloud build API saving around 25% of firmware flash usage.

Unified targets define hardware drivers to be included in the firmware as described in the [Hardware specification](/docs/manufacturer/manufacturer-design-guidelines#42-definitions-for-unified-targets)

The build log has information about the build in case of failure.

## Usage

For optimal use please select ONLY the appropiate hardware for the flight controller after selecting the right target (using auto-detect button).
