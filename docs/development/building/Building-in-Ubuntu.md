# Building in Ubuntu

Building for Ubuntu platform is remarkably easy.
This document is tested and based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS release and can also be used for WSL.

### Clone Betaflight Repository and Install Toolchain

Cloning the Betaflight repository will create a folder named `betaflight` in your current folder and download a copy for local use. You may wish to begin in a project folder such as `~/Git/`, `~/Github/`, or `~/My-Projects/`. Your local clone will not be automatically synced when Betaflight's github repository is updated; Syncing must be done manually. If development and pull-requests is intended, then please see the "[Git and Github](../Git)" section. The following command-lines will install necessary prerequisites, clone and setup Betaflight.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt -y install build-essential git curl clang-18 python3 python-is-python3
git clone https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight.git
cd betaflight
make arm_sdk_install
make configs
```

### Updating and Rebuilding Firmware

Navigate to your local betaflight repository and use the following steps to pull the latest changes and rebuild your version of betaflight:

```
git pull
make MATEKF405 [EXTRA_FLAGS="-DUSE_RANGEFINDER"] [DEBUG=DBG]
```

Using the optional EXTRA_FLAGS parameters you can specify options like USE_RANGEFINDER.
Using the optional DEBUG parameter you can specify the debugger.

You'll see a set of files being compiled, and finally linked, yielding both an ELF and then a HEX.
You can use the Betaflight-Configurator to flash the `obj/betaflight_MATEKF405.hex` file.
Make sure to remove `obj/` and `make clean`, before building again.

### Building Betaflight Configurator

Change to your project-folder if desired. (e.g. `cd ~/Git`)

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install libatomic1 npm
sudo npm install -g gulp-cli yarn
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
git clone https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator.git
cd betaflight-configurator
nvm install
yarn install
yarn build
yarn vite
```

This will start a local server for Betaflight Configurator. Use a Web-Serial compatible web browser to visit `http://localhost:8000/`. Press `q`, then `Enter` in the terminal to quit. You may delete the `nohup.out` file if it remains after quitting. Please see https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator?tab=readme-ov-file#betaflight-configurator for further details.

See [Betaflight Configurator Development](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator#development) for how to build the Betaflight Configurator.

### Flashing a Target with Betaflight Configurator

In most Linux distributions the user won't have access to serial interfaces by default. Flashing a target requires configuration of usb for dfu mode. To add this access right type the following command in a terminal:

```
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
sudo apt-get remove modemmanager
sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/46-stdfu-permissions.rules <<EOF
# DFU (Internal bootloader for STM32, AT32 and APM32 MCUs)

ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="df11", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e3c", ATTRS{idProduct}=="df11", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="314b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0106", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"
EOF
```

Please log out and log in to active the settings. You should now be able to flash your target using Betaflight Configurator.
