# Welcome to the Manufacturer Section

### Information for Manufacturers

Betaflight is Open Source Firmware and we seek to co-operate closely with hardware manufacturers in order to ensure that both they and our users get the best out of Betaflight.

This section is intended to help provide information to manufacturers to guide the product development, and subsequent application to create official inclusion into the firmware as a target which users can flash.

Contact information and translation is provided so that we can collaborate more easily.
