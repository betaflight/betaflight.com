# Config Target Guidance - Cloud Build

Due to the increase in poorly designed flight controllers, primarily clones of known poorly designed units, Betaflight is now taking a strong stance on adding targets to our cloud build platform.

:::note
The Betaflight project will no longer accept new flight controller designs using the STM F4 and F7 series microcontroller where there is more than 4 motor outputs.

- We strive to be the best flight experience available on the widest range of hardware. To continue delivering that we now need to limit flight controller designs using the older microcontrollers that have restrictions on timer and DMA resources.

- Moving forward these microcontrollers should only be used on budget freestyle or racing designs and for AIOs that only require 4 motor outputs. The STM H743 is now very close in price to the F405 and is a much better choice. We recommend the H743 be used in high performance, high motor output and high IO flight Controller designs where an STM microcontroller is preferred by the designer or manufacturer.

- Existing designs will not be affected by this change but features maybe restricted for those flight controllers in the future where performance becomes an issue.

:::note
The Betaflight project has deprecated implementation of new STM F411 applications, SPI for RX communications and no longer recommends BMI270:

- The STM F411 has been a stable option for those smaller FCs. Whilst the cloud build has extended its useful life (with the limited flash size), the limited available IO renders this chip a poor choice for future designs. We are therefore going to restrict acceptance of new targets with this chipset, in favour of AT32, PICO or G4 options. Existing targets will continue to be supported for the time being.

- New targets for designs that use SPI for RX communications will not be accepted. This is because we favour the use of serial for RX communications, which is also inline with the wishes of the ELRS development team. Existing targets will maintain support for the time being.

- The BMI270 IMU is no longer recommended due to calibration issues (drift).

**Betaflight is free software**, and will continue to be free, however the automated build and delivery system is not free and comes with operational costs. Supporting the costs of running the cloud build system is optional. You are free to distribute your own hexes however you choose. Your customers are able to flash your distributed firmware using the “Load Local” function of the betaflight configuration and maintenance application.

:::note

It is advised to start a dialogue with the Betaflight team before you move to making prototypes. The Betaflight team will endeavor to create a reference library to assist manufacturers as early as possible in the process.
