## Introduction

Betaflight is an open source firmware project, and runs on third party electronics hardware. This
means that the Betaflight firmware development team does not have control over the hardware
designs or specifications. However the performance of the firmware is related to the hardware
on which it runs. Thus for the sake of the FPV community, this program aims to minimize issues
that users have, by offering recommendations and guidance to manufacturers direct from the
development team. Hardware manufacturers can now benefit from active engagement with the
Betaflight development team - giving them access to their skills, experience and advice - to
produce better hardware and more successful designs.

## Betaflight 4.3 - 'Recommended Direction'

For version 4.3 a team of Betaflight developers started a 'Hardware Specification' program
discussing a recommended direction for current and future hardware design and development.
The document 'Manufacturer Design Guidelines' is available [here](/docs/development/manufacturer/manufacturer-design-guidelines), and represents the first time that recommendations are officially made directly from
the Betaflight developers to manufacturers. We encourage manufacturers to read this document
and offer feedback.

## Betaflight 4.4 - 'A New Relationship'

Since releasing the Manufacturer Guidelines we have opened new communication channels
with selected manufacturers within the application/website [Discord](https://discord.betaflight.com/invite). The goal was to discuss
issues and engage with the companies, as well as test their hardware in order to verify the
quality and performance. As part of the incentive to encourage engagement, we are offering a
'Betaflight Partnership' official certification to manufacturers. They can use this certification to
indicate to the userbase that they are supported by Betaflight and our development program.
This will be valuable promotion for them to increase purchasing confidence from customers.

## Betaflight 4.5 - 'Professional Support Services'

The outreach from Betaflight to the manufacturers has been a great success, to the extent that Betaflight has decided to transition from the limited availability service of the open source model, to professional support services. The FPV sector has grown significantly, with Betaflight at the forefront as the largest UAV firmware, thus demands on developers time has grown significantly. This new setup will provide the type of reliable support expected by businesses in order to fit to development timelines.
