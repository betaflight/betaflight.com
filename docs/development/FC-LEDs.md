# Betaflight Flight Controller LED usage

Betaflight Flight Controllers typically have two LEDs, possibly three which indicate the conditions below.

FCs implement at least one LED to indicate activity. The second is preferable, and the third optional.

| LED Number | Colour | Required   | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
