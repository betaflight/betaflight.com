:::caution Work in progress

This site is still new. Very new. As of writing this, it's only 5 days since we started working on it.
So it's still very much a work in progress. Pages going to be added, updated and improved pretty every day
in the weeks to come. So if you're missing something, please be patient. It will come! You can also help
us out, check out the `#documentation` channel on the [Discord server](https://discord.betaflight.com/invite)
for more info.

## Translators

We want to make Betaflight accessible for pilots who are not fluent in English, and for this reason we are currently maintaining translations into 21 languages for Betaflight Configurator: Català, Dansk, Deutsch, Español, Euskera, Français, Galego, Hrvatski, Bahasa Indonesia, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Latviešu, Português, Português Brasileiro, polski, Русский язык, Svenska, 简体中文, 繁體中文.
We have got a team of volunteer translators who do this work, but additional translators are always welcome to share the workload, and we are keen to add additional languages. If you would like to help us with translations, you have got the following options:

- if you help by suggesting some updates or improvements to translations in a language you are familiar with, head to [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/betaflight-configurator) and add your suggested translations there;
- if you would like to start working on the translation for a new language, or take on responsibility for proof-reading the translation for a language you are very familiar with, please head to the Betaflight Discord chat (registration [here](https://discord.gg/n4E6ak4u3c)), and join the ['translation'](https://discord.com/channels/868013470023548938/1057773726915100702) channel - the people in there can help you to get a new language added, or set you up as a proof reader.
