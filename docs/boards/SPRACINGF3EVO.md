## FAQ & Known Issues
* Softserial is disabled for this target in bf 3.1.7 but works in nightly build 3.2.0 as of today (2017-05-13).
* DSHot does not work out of the box, due to DMA limitations. The solution to enable DSHOT on this board is to remap motor 4 to motor pin 5 (A06), this can be done through CLI as follows:

`resource MOTOR 5 NONE`

`resource MOTOR 4 A06`

`save`

Note that, if you wish to use SDCARD Blackbox logging with DSHOT, you will have to disable SDCARD DMA. This will negatively impact SDCARD logging rate. As of BF 3.2.0-RC3 there is no other solution. This can be done as follows:

`set sdcard_dma = OFF`

`save`
