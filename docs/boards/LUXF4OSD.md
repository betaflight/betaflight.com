## iBus and SmartAudio
As this FC has only one UART (UART6) provided as pins, it can be tricky to get iBus (that needs a UART RX) and SmartAudio working at the same time. Here is a solution to get this accomplished:
1) Solder iBus to the Pad labled RX6 and SmartAudio to the Pad labeled TX6.
2) Configure iBus in Betaflight as usual for Port 6
3) Run the following commands in CLI:

`resource PWM 3 NONE`

`resource SERIAL_TX 6 NONE`

`resource SERIAL_TX 11 C06`

`feature SOFTSERIAL`

`save`

4) Now you should find another soft-serial on your ports-tab that you can use to configure SmartAudio
