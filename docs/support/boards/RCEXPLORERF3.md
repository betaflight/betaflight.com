## FAQ & Known Issues

No known issues yet.

The default resource mappings on all boards are for use on a quadcopter. If you want to use the board for a tricopter, you will have to manually remap the resources so you get a resource for the tail servo. This should work for the F3FC (Rcexplorer FC)

resource MOTOR 1 A08
resource MOTOR 2 B00

resource MOTOR 4 NONE
resource MOTOR 5 NONE
