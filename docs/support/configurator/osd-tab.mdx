# OSD Tab

Betaflight OSD allows the pilot to view in-flight information and telemetry data overlaid onto their FPV camera feed.
This is where you can configure the OSD elements and their layout, as well as the alarms and warnings which will be
displayed.

OSD requires a supported device. Supported devices include the onboard MAX7456 featured in many flight controllers, the
FrSky OSD board and digital VTXs which support the MSP Displayport protocol.

OSD elements enabled by toggling the checkbox next to the element. Elements can then be moved by dragging them around 
the Preview pane, changes are reflected in real-time and viewable via the VTX and goggles. Three profiles are available
 and can be swapped to provide different elements and layouts.

## Active OSD profiles

Selects the OSD profile which will be overlaid on the camera data.

## Video Format

* **Auto** - attempts to guess the appropriate output type

* **PAL** - Uses a 30 columns x 16 row grid of OSD elements. If the MAX7456 chip is used then this must match the 
camera signal

* **NTSC** - Uses a 30 columns x 13 row grid of OSD elements. If the MAX7456 chip is used then this must match the 
camera signal

* **HD** - Used by Digital VTXs which accept OSD commands via MSP Displayport

:::info

HD OSD defaults to a 53 column x 20 row grid of
OSD elements. When the VTX is online BetaFlight will query via MSP Displayport to determine the optimum grid size and 
may update the grid to match what is supported by the digital VTX system
