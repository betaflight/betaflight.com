In order to convert between Betaflight, RaceFlight and FlightOne rates, the converters below can be used. There is also now a converter for Betaflight, Raceflight, KISS, Actual and QuickRates below. Please note that not every curve can be recreated perfectly in a different rate model.

Actual and Quick rates use max velocity directly as a variable (velocity in degree/sec at maximum stick deflection). If you put rates of a different rate model into the configurator it shows you the corresponding max velocity.
