Some boards include a current sensor in order to provide measures such as "Battery current draw", "Battery current mAh drawn" and others. More often than not, the current sensor has to be thoroughly calibrated for the measures to be accurate. Also, Betaflight includes a Virtual Current Sensor feature that can be used when the current sensor is missing or broken. This sensor needs a different calibration procedure to be performed in order to provide reasonably accurate measures. The Betaflight documentation includes very valuable advice on how to calibrate both sensors: [Battery.md](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/docs/Battery.md)
