# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Local Development

```bash
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## ESLint Prettier

We use eslint and prettier for code formatting.

Husky is configured as a pre-commit hook to run both on commit, make sure it is setup correct and it runns before you commit your code.

## Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
$ USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
